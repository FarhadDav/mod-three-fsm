This project contains logic for FSM generator and ModThree concrete implementation. 
Users are able to instantiate a ModThree object and provide input to the `calculate()` method.
It uses the FSM class to generate a Finite State Machine based on the spec inside the ModThree class.
It also uses State enum to map state to the desired numeric output.
